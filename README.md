# Password Advisor
--------------

Admit, our lives depend on Internet. We spend a lot of time online connecting with friends and people around the globe, sharing our photos and emotions in social media, creating tonns of accounts on various websites and even typing in our credit card details. Of course we do not want our personal information to be stolen. That is why we
use passwords! Hmm, hold on. We all heard about data breaches, which led to users losing access to their personal accounts or even financial losses. So, passwords are not "buletproof"?

No, they are not. Fortunately, we can check if our passwords were hacked. This app uses public API to check if your password were noticed in latest data breaches, hacker attacks, etc. Worried about security? Say no more! This application uses SHA256 encryption algorithm to securely hash you password, requests a list of known compromised passwords and analyzes it. Does the API server know what password you are checking? No! Can your password be compromised while checking. No! (unless somebody is watching behind your shoulder. Watch out!)

Hopefully, this app will help you to improve your cyber security. Remember always use unique passwords and store them in secured place (preferably your head).
